== PROJECT: SugarMummy

---

== Overview

SugarMummy is a desktop application tailored for type 2 diabetics to better manage their day-to-day life.
Users interact with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has
about 19 kLOC.

Besides being a schedule planner cum reminder app, SugarMummy also supports logging of data such as
blood sugar level and BMI. As these data are closely linked to the severity of type 2 diabetes, data
can be summarized over a time period and presented in a visually intuitive graphical form. This helps
users to track progressions better. Moreover, there are achievements waiting to be unlocked and they serve
as extrinsic motivation for users to keep a healthy lifestyle. GUI font color and background are also
customizable to fully enhance user experience. The diet aspect is also taken care by SugarMummy which
recommends food and snacks beneficial for type 2 diabetics upon request.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to view daily, weekly or monthly average in a graphical form.
** What it does: `average` command allows users to track their daily, weekly or monthly progressions for different
record types. Averages are presented in a line graph. Different parts of the graph background are also colored differently
to demarcate healthy and unhealthy values. The graph also shows a legend box to describe the color used.
** Justification: Without this feature, user can only track their progression using `list` command. This requires them
to scroll through possibly hundreds and even thousands of records. Due to this infeasibility, `average` command is
introduced. The main part of tracking progression is to see the general trend
and this justifies the use of line graph. Lastly, graph demarcations are used because users may not
be familiar with the range of healthy and unhealthy values.
** Highlights: The first difficulty encountered when implementing this feature was how to group records
from same day, week or month together without using a separate code for each type. The solution can be
found in link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-1/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/sugarmummy/model/statistics/AverageMap.java[`AverageMap.java`].
The second difficulty was highlighting graph background with colors. JavaFX `LineChart` does not support
such functionality hence I had to implement the functionality using through link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-1/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/sugarmummy/ui/statistics/CustomLineChart.java[`CustomLineChart.java`]
which overrides JavaFX `LineChart`.
