== PROJECT: SugarMummy

---

== Overview

SugarMummy is a desktop application used to manage a type-II diabetic lifestyle. The user interacts with it using a CLI,
and it has a GUI created with JavaFx. It is written in Java and has about 24 kLOC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability for the application to provide a personalised user experience for the
user through a user biography and achievements.*
** What it does: Allows the user to view, add, edit and clear his / her biography of important personal information, as well as attain different levels of achievements upon meeting predefined requirements.
** Justification: These features improve the product significantly because a user would want to add a user profile with useful information especially in times of emergency and acquire a sense of achievement at different milestones.
** Highlights: These enhancements benefit commands to be added in future since new fields in a user's biography as well as achievement could be easily defined in further developments. Implementation of the `Achievements` sub-feature in
particular was challenging as it required careful interaction with other features such as the `average` feature and
`record` instances, and maintaining balance between abstraction and minimising coupling.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Added the ability for users to change font and background to any hexadecimal-value colour or image for background,
with support to set predefined background image sizes and repeat patterns.
** Added over 600+ motivational quotes to be selected at random and shown to the user for each session of the
running of the program.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#=undefined&search=whneo97[View RepoSense]]
