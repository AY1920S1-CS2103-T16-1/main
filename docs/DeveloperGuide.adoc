== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/sugarmummy/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/sugarmummy/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/sugarmummy/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/sugarmummy/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/sugarmummy/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/sugarmummy/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/sugarmummy/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.sugarmummy.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::average[]
=== Average graph feature

The average graph shows how the average blood sugar level or BMI of users change over time.
Daily, weekly, monthly average are supported.

==== Implementation

User input to find average graph is parsed by `SugarMummyParser` which creates a new `AverageCommandParser`.
`AverageCommandParser` then parses user input and creates a new `AverageCommand`. Next, `AverageCommand`
performs operations on `AverageMap` in `Model` with the help from `RecordContainsRecordTypePredicate` to
filter `UniqueRecordList` in `Model`. The result of the execution is returned to `Ui` as a
`CommandResult` object and is displayed to the user. In addition, `Ui` calls and display average graph
related `.fxml` file to the user.

The average graph is implemented by `AverageMap` and the average values are stored
internally as `internalMap`. Additionally, it implements the following method:

* `AverageMap#calculateAverage()` - calculates and stores the average values needed by `AverageCommand`.
* `AverageMap#asUnmodifiableObservableMap()` - returns a read only version of `internalMap`.


These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#calculateAverageMap()` and
`Model#getAverageMap()` respectively.

===== Example Usage Scenario
Below is an example usage scenario and how average graph is created.

Step 1. User launches the application for the first time. The `AverageMap` will be
initialized and `internalMap` will be empty.

Step 2. User enters `average a/daily rt/bloodsugar n/4` in SugarMummy to get daily average blood sugar.
Input is parsed and send to `AverageCommand`. `AverageCommand` then calls `Model#updateFilteredRecordList`
to filter record list with `RecordContainsRecordTypePredicate`. This results in a list of
records containing only blood sugar records. Subsequently, `AverageCommand` calls
`Model#calculateAverageMap()` to update the `internalMap` with new average values by using the filtered
record list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the average operation works:

.Sequence diagram of how average command calculates average values.
image::AverageSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AverageCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Step 2a. If the user enters `average a/daily rt/bloodsugar n/4` and there is no data available,
then the command will fail to execute and throw a `CommandException`. Alternatively, if user enters
an invalid command, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
This is illustrated in the activity diagram below.

.Activity diagram of user enter an average command.
image::AverageCommandFailureActivityDiagram.png[]

Step 3. `Ui` receives average `CommandResult` from `LogicManager` and creates a new `AverageGraphPane`
as well as all other necessary components (see below). `Ui` then displays the `AverageGraphPane` to
user.

Average graph Ui consists of several parts:

* `AverageGraphPane`: Placeholder for `AverageGraph` and `LegendPane`.
* `AverageGraph`: Contains the average graph. Data points are generated by `internalMap`.
* `CustomLineChart`: Overrode JavaFx `LineChart`, the implementation for average graph.
* `LegendPane`: Placeholder for `LegendRow`. This is a legend box for average graph.
* `LegendRow`: Consists of a colored legend symbol and its description.

.Class diagram of average graph ui related classes.
image::AverageUiClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to display average graph to user.

The dilemma arises because users, especially recently diagnosed Type II diabetics,
do not know the normal range of BMI and blood sugar level. An intuitive and aesthetically
pleasing method is needed to convey this information to user.

* **Alternative 1:** Use JavaFx `LineChart` to display the average graph and display the ranges below
the graph using JavaFx `Label`.
** Pros: Do not need to implement anything.
** Cons: User need to trace data points to the y axis to find it's value and compare it with the
ranges given below the graph. This can be annoying and tedious for the user.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Override JavaFx `LineChart` by adding horizontal range markers
to the graph and color the area between the markers.
** Pros: User is able to tell which range a particular data point falls in immediately.
** Cons: Need to implement horizontal range markers and lay it out on the graph. Moreover,
a custom legend box is needed to label the horizontal range markers.
// end::average[]

// tag::recmf[]
=== Food Recommendation Feature
The food recommendation feature externally shows a filtered food list in the form of cards. Internally, it mainly consists of three parts:

* Food Model: holds data for a certain food
* Predicates: indicates the filters that the user wants to apply on partial presentation of the foods
* Unique Food List: holds the collection of all foods

==== Overview
* Internal Data Structure
+
The `UniqueFoodList` is the main model that contains all the foods and interacts with logic and UI. It exposes an
unmodifiable `ObservableList<Food>` that associates the UI display of food recommendations.

image::FoodModelClassDiagram.png[]

* Parsers
** `RecmFoodCommandParser` specifies the filters applied on the food list. Filters are implemented by two `Predicate` and are based on `Flag` and / or `FoodName`.
** `AddFoodCommandParser` specifies and checks each fields of a new input food.

* UI: Two main components are `FoodCard`, which shows the food information, and `FoodFlowPanel`: holds all the cards. It is nested in a `Scrollable` One highlight of the design is the background color usage for food name. Different colors are corresponding to different types of foods.

==== Implementation

The food recommendation mechanism majorly implements the following operations:

* `SugarMummy#recmf()` -- Recommends a list of foods to the user.
* `SugarMummy#sort()` -- Sorts the recommendations in ascending or descending order in terms of food name or calorie, gi, sugar, and fat values.
* `SugarMummy#addfood()` -- Inputs new foods into the database for future recommendations.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredFoodList()`, `Model#sortFilteredFoodList()`, `Model#addFood()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the food recommendation mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and enter `recmf` Command for the first time and . The `foodlist.json` storage file will be initialized with the pre-loaded food data from `SampleFoodDataUtil`.

Step 2. The user executes `recmf -f -sv` command. `IsWantedTypePredicate` will be applied on the food list to select specified types.

[NOTE]
If no flag is specified, `RecmFoodCommandParser#getParsedFlags()` will return all flags to show to full content of foods.

Step 3. The user executes `recmf fn/Cherry`. Similar to step 2, `FoodNameContainsKeywordPredicate` will be applied.

Step 4. The user executes `recmf sort/calorie`.

[NOTE]
Collectively, Step 2 to 4 have similar underlying logic implementation and Ui updates. The whole food list wil be iterated through to get a filter or reordered food list.

Step 5. The user feels the database is insufficient and wants to add a new food by executing `addfood (FOOD INFO)`. The `foodlist.json` storage file will be immediately updated if the execution is successful.

* The following sequence diagram shows how the typical food recommendation operation works: `recmf -f fn/Cherry`

image::RecmFoodSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
The lifeline for `RecmFoodCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

* The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes `addfood` command.

image::AddFoodActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How recommendations are presented to user

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Shows the user a pane of cards. Different types are indicated by the different background colors of the food names.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons:
* **Alternative 2:** Use several scrollable horizontal list views to hold different food type.
** Pros:
*** The content is more organized and the user does not need to specify food types in the filter.
*** The food card for different food types can be more targeted. For example, for most proteins, the sugar and gi of value 0 can be omitted while protein values can be added.
** Cons: The operations targeting at the whole list, such as filtering based on food names, need to be applied repeatedly for each food list.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the recmf command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store all the foods
** Pros: The logic can be easily understood.
** Cons:
* **Alternative 2:** Use a map that maps different food types to corresponding food list
** Pros:
** Cons:

===== Aspect: New food data input from user

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Require inputs for all fields (e.g. calorie, gi...).
** Pros: It is easy for data manipulation. Specifically, this prevents some foods from permanently having empty fields. Additionally, this may further hinder the data usage for data analysis.
** Cons: Some data may not be currently available while the user still to want to record a new food by simply inputting the food name.
* **Alternative 2: ** Allow temporarily empty fields and use a separate list to hold such incomplete inputs.
** Pros: This provides the user with more freedom and flexibility of entering data.
** Cons: Every change or manipulation on food data needs to be applied on two lists. Transferring data from one list to the other may also be error-prone.

// tag::dataencryption[]

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

==== Future Development Direction

** Larger database for food recommendations
To increase the usability of food recommendations, it is suggested to have more food data at the beginning instead of depending on user inputs. Ideally, the recommendation data can be connected to online database for dynamic updates while can have local storage for offline operations.

** Diet records and analysis
The current food models can be utilized to help record daily diets. This would allow the user to have an overview of his food consuming statistics. Therefore, some suggestions can be proposed to help diabetes users regulate and plan their diets.
// end::recmf[]

//tag::datalogDG[]
=== [Proposed] Data log feature
==== Proposed Implementation
The multi-record data logging mechanism is facilitated by a new Record package containing  BloodSugar and Bmi classes that extend an abstract Record class. Add, list and delete command classes and parsers are modified to accommodate multiple record types. Multi-record data is stored internally as a recordList where members are Records.

It implements the following operations:
* `Model#addRecord()` — Adds a record to the record list. 
* `Model#deleteRecord()` — Deletes a record from the record list. 
* `Model#getUniqueRecordListObject()` — Retrieves all records in record list. 
These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addRecord()`, `Model#deleteRecord()` and `Model#getUniqueRecordListObject()` respectively.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the data log feature behaves at each step.
Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. If `recordList.json` is not found in `/data`, a `recordList.json` will be produced from `SampleRecordDataUtil#getSampleRecords()`. Otherwise, the recordList will be loaded from `recordList.json` using `UniqueRecordList#setRecord(<List>)` and checked for inconsistencies e.g. missing fields, invalid fields. If invalid fields or missing consequential fields that must be used (e.g. `BloodSugar`’s `Concentration` field is consequential while its `Height` and `Weight` fields are not) are detected, an Exception is thrown and `recordList.json` start from scratch. Otherwise, inconsequential fields will be automatically repopulated on saving to the `recordList.json` in any command.

Step 2. The user executes list command to list all records. `Model#getUniqueRecordListObject()` is called and `DisplayPaneType` is set to LIST. `MainDisplayPane#get()` determines the type of window to show based on `DisplayPaneType`. A new `RecordListPanel` is created and populates each `ListViewCell` with `BloodSugarRecordCard` and `BmiRecordCard`. Data used to populate the `RecordCards` is passed in through `RecordListPanel`’s constructor, as an `ObservableList` containing `BloodSugar` and `Bmi` objects.

Step 3. The user executes `add rt/BMI h/1 w/1 dt/2019-09-09 12:12` command to create a `Bmi` record with height 1, weight 1 at date 2019-09-09 and time 12:12. The add command is first parsed by `AddressBookParser` then parsed by `AddCommandParser`. In `AddCommandParser`, we first parse for standard `Record`-class-level field like `DateTime` before parsing for the relevant `Bmi`-related CLI-arguments defined in `CliSyntax`. Individual field parsing is done inside `ParserUtil`. Either a complete `BloodSugar` or `Bmi` Object is returned otherwise a `ParseException` will be thrown. Note that `BloodSugar` and `Bmi` Objects are `Record` Objects. In `AddCommand`, this `Record` Object is first checked against the model whether the model contains such a `Record` (defined as same date time in `Record.java`). If there is no duplicate, it is added to the `Model#addRecord()` in turn calling `ModelManager#addRecord()` to call `add()` operation on the list. We reuse similar code to step 2 to display the result of the add.

image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the record was a mistake, and decides to delete that record. The delete command is first parsed by `AddressBookParser` then parsed by `DeleteCommandParser`. In `DeleteCommandParser`, we use `ParseUtil` to check whether the index is a positive number, otherwise a `ParseException` will be thrown. `DeleteCommand` receives the positive index and checks whether the positive index indices a record. `DeleteCommand` will call `Model#deleteRecord()`, which will call `Model#deleteRecord()` and call `ModelManager#deleteRecord()` performing a `remove()` operation on the list.

Step 5. After command has executed in `LogicManager`, we attempt to write the recordList in memory to `recordList.json` on disk using `Storage#saveRecordList()`. The command result is returned to `MainWindow` which calls `MainDisplayPane` in step 2 using `MainWindow#switchToMainDisplayPane()`. This lists out the updated record list in the UI (step 2).


==== Design Considerations
==== Aspect: Commands and parsers implementation
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Parse for new record type X within existing add, list, delete commands and their parsers
** Pros: Easy to implement as long as record type X inherits from Record. AddCommand, ListCommand and DeleteCommand classes remain very similar to their original implementations. 
** Cons: Harder to debug when parsing fails because XCommandParser classes are responsible for checking for presence of multiple fields of multiple record types. Parsing may become complicated if the order of parsing fields becomes important. 
* **Alternative 2:** Create separate AddX, ListX, DeleteX, AddXParser, ListXParser, DeleteXParser for each new record type X introduced
** Pros: Each parser is responsible for parsing only record type X’s fields. This narrows down the scope of debugging should parsing fail. 
** Cons: Accommodating a new record type involves creating at least 6 additional classes just for operations on data classes. Data classes required to represent the data include: Bmi class with Height and Weight class. 

==== Aspect: Data Structure for managing multiple record types
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a single list to store multiple record types.

** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. Simpler to implement.

** Cons: Must conduct type checks when retrieving from list. When a new record type is added, all type checks in different places must be updated. 
* **Alternative 2:** Use separate lists to store different record types.
** Pros: Do not need to perform type checks when retrieving from list. 
** Cons: Listing all records together becomes difficult, must build a new list from all separate lists. Each class must reference a different kind of list.
//end::datalogDG[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Calendar feature
==== Implementation

The calendar feature works along with a scheduler. Calendar stores internally a `calendarEntries` list and a `pastReminders` list.
Calendar entries consists of reminders and events. Past reminders list is dynamically determined by time and all reminders in this
list is shown to the user. The scheduler acts as a wrapper for the Java ScheduledExecutorService, which updates past reminder list at specific time.
See the class diagram below for calendar related classes.

image:CalendarClassDiagram.png[width=75%]

The following activity diagram shows how event command and scheduler works:

image:CalendarActivityDiagram.png[width=90%]

It implements the following operations:

* 'Calendar#addCalendarEntry' -- Adds a new calendar entry to the calendar.
* 'Calendar#addPastReminder' -- Adds a reminder to the past reminders list.
* 'Calendar#getCalendarEntryList' -- Gets a list of calendar entries.
* 'Calendar#getPastReminderList' -- Gets a list of past reminders.
* 'Calendar#schedule' -- Schedules a series of upcoming reminders.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addCalendarEntry()`, `Model#addPastReminder()`,
 `Model#getFilteredCalendarEntryList()`, `Model#getPastReminderList` and `Model#schedule` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the calendar behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time on Dec 14 2019 09:00(local time). The `Calendar` will be initialized with the initial calendar state, which includes an empty calendar
entry list and an empty past reminder list.

Step 2. The user executes `reminder d/insulin injection dt/2019-12-14 17:30 r/daily` command to add a new reminder of 'insulin inject' at 17:30 every day. The `reminder` command calls `Model#addCalendarEntry()`,
causing the modified state of the calendar after the reminder command executes to be saved in the `calendarEntries` list. Subsequently, it calls `Model#schedule()` which forces the scheduler to update the upcoming
reminders.

Step 3. The user executes `event d/meeting dt/2019-12-14 14:30 tp/00:30` command to add an new event with an auto reminder scheduled 30 minutes
before the event. It calls `Model#addCalendarEntry()`, causing a new event as well as a new reminder saved in the `calendarEntries` list. Subsequently, it calls `Model#schedule()` which forces the scheduler to
update the upcoming reminders.

[NOTE]
If an event or reminder command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#addCalendarEntry()`, so the calendar state will not be saved into the `calendarEntryList`.

Step 4. At 14:00, a scheduled task is executed to call `Model#addPastReminder()` and it adds the dinner event reminder to the `pastReminders` list.

Step 5. At 17:30, a scheduled task is executed to call `Model#addPastReminder()` and it adds the dinner event reminder to the `pastReminders` list.

The following sequence diagram shows how a single `reminder` command works:
image:CalendarSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How scheduler updates upcoming reminders

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Cancels all scheduled reminders and reschedule according to the updated reminder entries.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of time.
* **Alternative 2:** Updates scheduled reminders according to the newly added reminder.
** Pros: Will has less repeated work.
** Cons: More work to do on deciding which tasks to cancel.

===== Aspect: Period of updating scheduler.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Updates scheduler at 23:59(local time) every day.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have a large number of scheduled tasks which will not be executed before the applicaion is closed.
* **Alternative 2:** Updates scheduler every hour.
** Pros: More flexible scheduling without concerning date and less scheduled tasks.
** Cons: May cause overhead due to frequently updating.

//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgPppPart0[]
=== Personalised User Experience Feature
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgPppPart0[]

To personalise the diabetic user’s the experience in using the SugarMummy app, several sub-features are used,
including:

* Addition, editing and clearing of the user’s biography
* Customisation of font and `background` colour, with the ability to set as `background` image for `background` as well.
* Display of motivational quotes for the user (initialisation phase; in progress)
* `Achievements` to be shown to the user upon achieving a milestone.

//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgOverviewPppPart1[]
==== Overview
* The `User` class is used to represent a diabetic user. A diabetic user is composed of the `Name`, `ProfileDesc`,
`DisplayPicPath`, `Nric`, `Gender`, `Phone`, `MedicalCondition`, `Address`, `Goal` and `OtherBioInfo` classes.
* A `User` is currently defined to be able to have more than one `Phone`, `MedicalCondition` and `Goal`. As such,
these classes inherit the `ListableField` Interface.
* The structure of a `User` and its interactions are shown as follows:

image::UserModelClassDiagram.png[]
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgOverviewPppPart1[]

* A `User` implements `ListableField` by storing them in a java `List`.
* A `User` that is created is added to a `UserList`. Although not more than one `User` can be added in current versions
so as to enhance personalisation for the, future developers may decide to repurpose the app to allow more users, and
their corresponding biographies represented by the `bio` fields, to the `UserList`.
* Other personalisation features such as `fontcolour`, `background` and `achievements` are currently represented by
independent classes `Colour`, `Background` and `Achievement` respectively on their own, representing the model as their
name describes.
* The `Colour` feature allows for either enumeration of colour names or hexadecimal colour codes to be used to set
colour. `Background` is associated to `Colour` as an argument for `Background` could simply be a colour. It depends on
the static method isValid`Colour`(String test) method to determine if it’s argument is a `Colour`
* The `AddBioParser` and `EditBioParser` is currently used to parse command arguments given by the user and allows
adding of specific biography fields, whereas the `FontColour` and `Background` parsers are used to parse arguments for
other personalisation features for font colours and `background` respectively.
* The `Ui` for personalisation is separated into distinct parts. `User`’s biography information and achievements page
are components on their own in the `Ui`’s `MainDisplayPane` – switched when required, whereas `background` and
`fontcolour` do not have a designated `Ui` window, but instead changes the attributes for the entire application by
modifying the CSS file used itself.
* All command words in this program, not restricted to this feature alone, are not case sensitive and implemented under
`SugarMummyParser`.

//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgBioPppPart1[]
==== Implementation
===== Biography
The biography feature is supported by the `addbio`, `editbio` and `clrbio` commands.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgBioPppPart1[]
Each command adheres to the main
flow of information used by this application. In other words, when a command is received, the command is first parsed
by `SugarMummyParser`, and to individual parsers where required, before return a `Command` object. The `Command` object
is then executed by `LogicManager`, during which it updates `ModelManager`, and after which Storage is updated, before feedback from
the `CommandResult` returned by the `Command` object is shown to the user back at the `Ui`.

* The following are possible scenarios for each of the following types of command words.

** Scenario 1: User keys in `addbio n/testMinimal p/91234567 e/81234567 /testMedicalCondition`
** Scenario 2: User keys in `editbio p/2/91234567`
** Scenario 3: User keys in `bio`
** Scenario 4: User keys in `clrbio`

* In all scenarios,
//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgBioPppPart2[]
`SugarMummyParser` responds to the command word via a series of switch cases.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgBioPppPart2[]
As mentioned above,
//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgBioPppPart3[]
`addbio` and `editbio` returns `AddBioCommandParser` and `EditBioCommandParser` respectively.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgBioPppPart3[]

* A key difference between the parsers for `addbio` and `editbio` is that the former requires `Name`, `ContactNumber`,
`EmergencyContact`, and `MedicalCondition` to be compulsory whereas `editbio` requires at least one argument denoting
the `User`’s biography field to be changed. Furthermore, `EditBioCommandParser` determines whether or not subarguments for
fields of `ListableField` type contain the format `INDEX/`, denoting the particular number in the list to be changed.
//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgBioPppPart4[]
* `CommandParser` then  returns an `AddBioCommand` object that stores the `User` to be created. `EditBioCommandParser` on
the other hand creates an `EditBioCommand` object that stores an `EditedUserDescription` containing information on which
fields are edited to be edited.
** A `List` of `HashMaps` that maps indices to `ListableField` is used in `EditedUserDescription` to denote changes to be made within each `ListableField`. When executed by `Logic` afterwards,
the `AddBioCommand` creates the `User` to be stored in the `ModelManager` whereas the `EditBioCommand` creates a new `User` based on
information in `EditedUserDescription`. A `UserList` is used in the `ModelManager` to store `User` instances.
** At any point of time when a user attempts to access biography information, `LogicManager` accesses the `UserList` from
`ModelManager` to display information. In order to be able to display the same information upon startup, `LogicManager` saves this
`UserList` to the storage after execution of each command.
* For the `bio` and `clrbio` commands, the implementations are relatively more straightforward.
** A `BioCommand` returned by `SugarMummyParser` simply overrides the `getDisplayPaneType()` of the `Command` object
(that each `Command` object contains) so that back at `Ui`, `Ui` knows to display the `BioPane` of the `Ui` in the
`MainDisplayPane` part of the window.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgBioPppPart4[]
** This is also done for all other biography-related commands so after each biography-related command, the
`BioPane` is displayed.  A `DisplayPane` is stored in the form of an enumeration as the type of display would be
predefined to all it’s accessors. The `ClearBioCommand` class simply clears the `UserList` stored in the `ModelManager` upon
execution.
* In the cases of `bio` and `clrbio` commands, `SugarMummyParser` requires non-null arguments just as it does for other
single-word commands such as `exit`.
* Each `Command` returns a `CommandResult` to logic containing feedback to be displayed to the user. Any exception
that is thrown to the user is caught back at `Ui` `Ui`. Feedback is displayed to the user using the `ResultsDisplayPane`.
The display of user biography is implemented using JavaFX `TableView`. If the `DisplayPicPath` of a `User` is unchanged,
the `Ui` does not reload the image, so as to optimise performance of the program. If an entire pane is left unchanged,
the pane is not reloaded, even upon execution of commands that are used to display the pane, unless explicitly indicated
in the `getNewPaneIsToBeCreated()` method of the. `Command`. Caching is implemented using a `HashMap` that maps
`DisplayPane` enumerations to the corresponding `UiPart` representing the respective pane.
//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgBioPppPart5[]
* An illustration of how the information flows for the `editbio` command is shown as follows:

image::EditBioSequenceDiagram.png[]
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgBioPppPart5[]

* The rest of the biography commands follow a similar logic, with key differences in the parser and command steps as
described above.  Validation within parsers are done via the `ParserUtil` class.

//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgAestheticsPppPart1[]
===== Aesthetics
The aesthetics aspects of the application help to support the feature of personalised user experience and are
implemented using the command words `fontcolour` and `bg` respectively.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgAestheticsPppPart1[]

* Possible valid usages are as follows:
** Scenario 1: User keys in `fontcolour`
** Scenario 2: User keys in `fontcolour white`
** Scenario 3: User keys in `fontcolour #FFFF00`
** Scenario 4: User keys in `bg`
** Scenario 5: User keys in `bg #000000`
** Scenario 6: User keys in `bg blue`
** Scenario 7: User keys in `bg /Users/John/displayPicture.jpg s/cover`
** Scenario 8: User keys in `bg r/no-repeat`

* As mentioned above,
//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgAestheticsPppPart2[]
`Colour` and `Background` are independent classes, and `Colour` makes use of enumerations of colour names and
hexadecimal colour codes to determine validity of the colours.

* Upon receival of the command `fontcolour`, if `fontcolour` has no arguments (checked by `FontColourParser`), a new
`FontColourCommand` with no arguments is returned, and upon execution return a `CommandResult` that shows the existing
`fontcolour` used via access of `ModelManager` (logic is similar to the ones for biography)
** Otherwise if arguments are received, validity of the arguments is checked against, and if the colour is a valid `Colour`,
it is set in `ModelManager` and saved to Storage. `FontColourCommand` overrides the `getDisplayPane()` to return the
`DisplayPane.COLOUR` enumeration. i.e. the `MainDisplayPane` is unchanged in `Ui`, and only font colours change.
* `Background` on the other hand, checks for additional possible arguments.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgAestheticsPppPart2[]
First of all, as observed in Scenarios 6
and 7, an argument could either represent a `Colour` or a path leading to an image to be used to set the background
picture (this is similar to the `DisplayPicPath` of `bio` field). Thus,
//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgAestheticsPppPart3[]
`BackgroundParser` first determines if the
argument received is a `Colour`. If so it returns a `BackgroundCommand` storing a `Background` that has a `backgroundColour` attribute. Otherwise, it checks, via `ParserUtil` , whether or not the argument before valid prefixes (preamble)
is a valid file path. If so, a `Background` that has a `backgroundPicPath` attribute is used to create the
`BackgroundCommand`.

** Otherwise a `ParseException` is returned.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgAestheticsPppPart3[]
Possible arguments that a `bg` command can have
include the size and repeat feature, corresponding to CSS `background` attributes.
** In current versions of the program, the program allows for fixed constants of this features to be used, that are stored in `BackgroundImageArgs` class and
used by the `Background` model for validation.
** `BackgroundCommand` overrides the `getDisplayPane()` method to return
`DisplayPane.BACKGROUND` enumeration. i.e. the `MainDisplayPane` is unchanged in `Ui`, and only the `background`
changes.
** Similar to font colour, the command word on its own simply displays to the user current `background` settings.
//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgAestheticsPppPart4[]
** An illustration of the logic for handling a `bg` command is shown as follows:

image::BackgroundActivityDiagram.png[]
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgAestheticsPppPart4[]

* For both `fontcolour` and `bg` commands, the StyleManager class of `Ui` is used to set the user’s intention of
`fontcolour` and `background` (if parsing is successful). The way StyleManager sets the `background` is by making a copy
of the existing StyleSheet used, modifying the required fields and setting it to the StyleSheets of the scene, internally.
* Perhaps an interesting area of the `Colour` and `Background` commands in more recent updates would include
implementation using command composition. The driving factor that fueled this is the need to ensure the `Fontcolour`
and `Background` do not have colours that are too similar (or otherwise the text could get difficult or impossible to see).
This above-mentioned checking was implemented by summing the square of the differences in red, green and blue channels'
values between the `Colour` of the `Fontcolour` and `Background`.
* The `Colour` for a `Background` with an image instead of a solid `Colour` is determined by extracting the
`Colour` that appears the most often using the `ImageTester` class.
* An major issue with checking for colour differences would be the situation when the user intends to make
changes to a `Fontcolour` that clashes with the `Background` if changed. Take for example a change in `fontcolour`
intended to be changed from white to black, with a background that is curently _already_ black. The system would not have
allowed changes of the text from white to black because of the background's black colour and would have suggested to
change the background first. The background is required to be changed to something much lighter so that the background can
be set to black. However, if the background cannot be changed to something that is lighter than it's current colour but
yet dark enough not to clash with the current background colour, then the user could find it hard to switch to the new
colours without going through a series of specific steps that would not cause colour clash.
* Command composition allows the `bg` and `fontcolour` commands to be combined such that the user is able to
set both the `background` and `fontcolour` simultaneously, and as such colour comparison is made solely between the
new colours entered rather than any of the current colours.
* `BackgroundParser` parses for `fontcolour/` and its arguments while `FontColourParser` parses for
`bg/` and its arguments. Any of these prefixes observed results in the Parser generating a `FontColourCommand` and
`BackgroundColourCommand` respectively. `BackgroundParser` then returns a `BackgroundColourCommand` that has a
`FontColourCommand` _stored_ in it and vice versa. When `LogicManager` executes `BackgroundCommand`, for instance,
`BackgroundCommand` executes the `FontColourCommand` stored in it as well. The necessary adjustments are made to model
accordingly and the feedback to users from both commands will be returned to the user.
* The idea of a command running another command allows commands such as `bg black fontcolour/red` to be entered by the
user. Modified methods in the `ArgumentMultimap` class of the `logic` package also allows the program to ensure that
the user does not enter multiple arguments of the same type at once eg. disallowing `bg black fontcolour/red
fontcolor/yellow`.

//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgAchievementsPppPart1[]
===== Achievements

* A diabetic user’s `Achievements` is supported by the `achvm` command, that displays the list of user’s achievements.
Similar to how `bio` is implemented, `SugarMummyParser` returns an `AchievementsCommand` that overrides the
`getDisplayPane()` method to return  `DisplayPane.ACHVM` – such that `Ui` of `Ui` sets the children of the
`MainDisplayPane` node to be the `AchievementsPane`. Each `Achievement` is represented using an `ImageView` in JavaFX
`TilePane` so that all images are of the same size.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgAchievementsPppPart1[]
* An `Achievement` is implemented as an abstract class in the `model` package. Each achievement contains attributes that
define the `Achievement` such as its `title` and `description` which specifies the requirements needed to attain it.
A significant attribute of the `Achievement` class is it's three states - `Achieved`, `Yet to Achieve` and `Previously
Achieved`. Another would be the `level` of the achievement (eg. `Bronze`, `Silver`, `Gold` etc.)
* Current `Achievement` objects have `recordType` `Bmi` and `BloodSugar`, with corresponding interfaces that represent
the `Achievement` for its `RecordType`. Specific classes inherit the `Bmi` and `BloodSugar` interfaces while extending
the `Achievement` abstract class to specify defining attributes and methods.
//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgAchievementsPppPart2[]
* When the program starts, an `AchievementsMap` containing a `Map` of `RecordType` to `List` of all `Achievement` objects
that the program has is created in `ModelManager`.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgAchievementsPppPart2[]
All `Achievement` objects are initially all at the state of `Yet to Achieve`.
//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgAchievementsPppPart3[]
* The `AchievementStateProcessor` class is then called, which iterates through the list of all `Record` elements
stored in `ModelManager` and updates the `State` of each `Achievement` if necessary.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgAchievementsPppPart3[]
* For each `RecordType` and `Level` of `Achievement`, the `AchievementStateProcessor` class checks whether the records
fulfils the requirements for a predefined number of consecutive days. Requirements are in turn determined by the
`MAXIMUM` and `MINIMUM` values stored in the interfaces of the `Achievement` class. State changes are made to the
`Achievement` class if requirements are fulfilled (eg. if the number of requirements of a `RecordType` for `Gold` are met,
then the `Achievement` of `level` `Gold` and of that particular `RecordType` would have it's state updated to reflect
that change. This is accomplished using methods such as the `promote` and `demote` in the `AchievementStateProcessor`).
* In order to determine whether requirements are fulfilled, interaction with not only the `RecordType` is implemented,
but also the methods of the `Average` feature (to obtain daily averages of record types before comparing them).
* A notable aspect of the implementation is the reversal of `level` from high to low level. This is such that if a
higher-level `Achievement` has been achieved, lower levels of achievement would also have been attained. In such cases,
the program automatically sets lower levels of `Achievement` to be achieved without having to iterate through the rest
of the `Record` elements in the `RecordList`.
//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgAchievementsPppPart4[]
* Thereafter, for each addition and removal of `Record` elements, the same process described above is used to update the
`AchievementsMap`, that maps `RecordType` to an `AchievementsList` of `Achievement` elements with updated `State` attributes.
* When the `achvm` command is received by the program, this `AchievementsMap` is simply retrieved from `ModelManager` to
`LogicManager` and the corresponding images representing the `Achievement` objects in the list, with their `State` values,
and attributes are presented to the user via the `MainDisplayPane` of the `MainWindow`.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgAchievementsPppPart4[]
* If the `AchievementsList` happens to be unchanged since the last time the pane is loaded in the same session, the pane
is not reload so as to optimise performance of the program and minimise unnecessary access and loading of images.

//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgMotivationPppPart1[]
===== Motivation

* Motivational aspects of the application are supported using motivational quotes.
* Each motivational quote exists as a `String` in an unmodifiable `List` of the class `MotivationalQuotes`.
* The `List` of quotes (collated from different sources but modified to have the same formats) are initialised to be part
of `ModelManager` when the program first starts up.
* Upon initialisation of the program, the `MotivationalQuotesLabel.fxml` file is referenced via its corresponding class.
* Retrieval of the `List` of motivational quotes is done via `LogicManager` which accesses the `List` of motivational quotes in
`ModelManager`.
* A quote is randomly selected and then displayed to the user via the program's user interface.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgMotivationPppPart1[]

//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgDesignConsiderationsPppPart1[]
==== Design Considerations
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgDesignConsiderationsPppPart1[]

===== Number of Users
* It could be argued that multiple user support is not required and thus a `UserList` should not be used to store data.
However, the intention is to leave it open to future developers to decide on whether to include multiple user support
for the application, as the choice of a fully personalised experience for diabetic patients versus functionality for
multiple users (having diabetes and using the same app), as well as the possibilities of such scenarios are debatable.
Furthermore, our user stories appear to suggest the desire for a more personalised application.
* In the strict case of single-user support that leaves the app less open to such modification, the alternative would be
to simply implement and store the `User` in `ModelManager`, rather than the `UserList`.

===== Background Sub-Argument Values
* The use of `enum` is a possibility to implement `static final background` sub-argument values (eg, `auto` of attribute
`background` size). However considerations that eventually led against this idea included the possibility of values that
are not in proper `String` format that may not be able to be directly enumerated (leading to the required use of
additional lengthy switch cases). Additionally other `background` fields may be added by future developers  and it would
be more concise to have them all in a single class rather than as separate enumerations.

//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgDesignConsiderationsPppPart2[]
===== Command Classification
* It is possible to separate the commands for  `fontcolour` and `background` into different commands (eg. `addfontcolour`,
`editfontcolour`, `showfontcolour`, `clrfontcolour`). However, this is likely unnecessary as this will not only require the
end user to type more words, but also introduce redundancy (eg. `clrfontcolour` could simply be `fontcolour black` and
this is not hard to achieve the same effects as `clrfontcolour`, which also adds a restrictive definition on what the
default colour to the user upon clearing settings should be).

===== Modification of Application Style Dynamically
* An alternative idea to achieving `fontcolour` and `background` throughout the entire app was to visit each `JavaFX` child `Node`
recursively and set the colours and backgrounds if the nodes are of specific instances with these attributes (eg.
`Label` which has `textfill` attribute). However this idea was quickly aborted as the `TableView` implemented only renders
headers after the scene has been set and to include such a case in thet recursive solution adds significant complexity
to the program on top of the possibility of severely breaking abstraction.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgDesignConsiderationsPppPart2[]

===== Restricting User Modification of Motivational Quotes
* The user is specifically designed to have no access in modifying the list as that would not only have taken away the
element of surprise but defeat the purpose of motivating the user one step at a time.
* Additionally, no additional commands for switching quotes are implemented as the user may simply restart the
application to generate a new `MotivationalQuote` out of the 600+ that are currently available.
* Future developers may decide to add more quotes, or implement the capability for users to add or modify them, but at
the moment we believe modification would be unnecessary as user-defined fields may also be achieved via other existing
features such as those in the biography. A user may furthermore add to quotes that may turn out to be discouraging
without knowing it, or accidentally delete quotes from the list unintentionally, making the user experience of the
feature much less deterministic.
* Daily motivational quotes were replaced with motivational quotes that change every time the application is restarted
as not only does it increase ease of testability, but also allows the user to encounter something different each time
the application is opened. Given the minimal ability intended for the user to modify the quotes, it is perhaps
important that a user who may not like what he is seeing on screen, or simply wishes to see something different. does
not have to wait till the end of the day in order for a change in quote to be observed.

==== Achievement Measures and Criteria
* It was difficult to define what a user needs to 'achieve' before he or she gets an achievement.
* The basic idea was to allow for different achievement levels which was eventually implemented. However, marking of the
boundaries of when a user attains an `Achievement` was debatable and could still be amongst developers.
* An initial consideration was to award users achievements based on the average of the data in their health records.
In other words, take the average of all data within a specific time period and award the achievement if the data within
that time period matches the requirement. However a major flaw with this idea was how users would eventually be able to
'cheat' - by minimising the number of days during which records are entered, and only recording data when results are
desirable. The other issue was the duration during which the average was determined. Suppose an achievement may be
attained by the user upon meeting requirements based on data over a year on _average_. This means that a user could
enter a record that meets the requirements in year 1, and then one year later enter another record that meets the
requirements. By this definition of achievements, the user could have received the achievement even though the records
may not have met requirements for the majority of year (especially for records that were not keyed in).
* Thus, user's achievements were defined by the actual duration during which they met requirements, and furthermore
for _consecutive_ number of days. i.e. streak
* This ensures that the user is incentivised not only to achieve good records (and in the process improve his or her
health), but also acquire a good habit of keying in and storing records.

//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgFutureDevelopmentsPppPart1[]
==== Future Developments

===== Saving of user's preferred themes: `[coming in v2.0]`

This feature has not currently been implemented, but could possibly be implemented using the existing
`StyleManager` class, which processes users' `background` and `fontColour`. A `List` could be used to save an
archive of users' preferred themes during that session.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgFutureDevelopmentsPppPart1[]
Adding, editing and deletion could be accomplished using `List`
methods. A `HashMap` could also be used such that the user can self-define names for each of the themes.
//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgFutureDevelopmentsPppPart2[]
A variable would serve as a current pointer to determine the current theme the user is using. A change in theme could
be achieved by updating the pointer and / or the `HashMap`, if any is implemented.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgFutureDevelopmentsPppPart2[]
If the user does not have any themes, then default aesthetics would be loaded, or if there is at least one set of saved
settings (as there is in this current version of the application), the users' preferences' in those settings would be
loaded.
//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgFutureDevelopmentsPppPart3[]
Upon termination of the program, the contents of the `HashMap` could be saved to a `JsonStorage` file.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgFutureDevelopmentsPppPart3[]

===== Displaying of cartoon avatar that represents the user: `[coming in v2.0]`

This feature has yet to be implemented but could possibly be implemented using a class / method that interacts with the
user's `RecordList`. A larger BMI of the user could be represented by a figure with a wider profile while a smaller BMI
could lead to the avatar being represented otherwise. Users could also have the option to enable and disable this feature.
This dynamically changing avatar could be achieved by combining shapes that change according to the values in `ReordList`,
or by using an existing library that allows for this.

//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgFutureDevelopmentsPppPart4[]
===== Follow up on user's goals: `[coming in v2.0]`

This feature has yet to be implemented but could possibly be implemented by first parsing inputs tat the user has
entered for the `Goal` fields. If in a format that is recognised, the program would store the recognised
parsed `Goal` and corresponding `LocalDate` in an `ArrayList` and `JsonStorage` file. The program would then check
the user's progress over time by analysing data in the user's `RecordList`, and provide timely feedback by
comparing the current date and date by which to reach the `Goal` targets set.
//end::personalisedUserExperienceDgFutureDevelopmentsPppPart4[]
For instance, the program may display a new alert-box like window via the `UI` indicating to user 'good job' for perhaps
being 'halfway there' in attaining set goals.
//tag::personalisedUserExperienceDgFutureDevelopmentsPppPart5[]
This feature may also implement some methods from the `Reminder` feature so the user can choose to automatically be
reminded about his/her `Goal` inputs at specific time intervals desired.

=== Deleting a person

. Deleting a person while all persons are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Average command

.. Prerequisites: There are exactly 7 different days of blood sugar and exactly 7 different days of BMI records.
... Test case: `average a/daily rt/bloodsugar` +
    Expected: Shows a graph with 5 data points. The dates of the 5 data points are the 5 most
    recent blood sugar records.
... Test case: `average a/daily rt/bmi n/10` +
    Expected: Since there are only 7 BMI records, the graph will only have 7 data points instead
    of 10.
... Test case: `average a/yearly rt/bmi n/3` +
    Expected: This is an unsupported average type. An error message is displayed saying +
    `Please enter correct input for a/AVERAGE_TYPE! +
    AVERAGE_TYPE is "daily", "weekly" or "monthly"`.
... Test case: `average a/weekly` +
    Expected: Missing compulsory field rt/RECORD_TYPE. An error message is shown: +
    `Oops! The command you've entered appears to be in an invalid format. +
    average: Shows daily/weekly/monthly average of different record types in a line graph. +
    Format: average a/AVERAGE_TYPE rt/RECORD_TYPE [n/COUNT] +
    Example: average a/daily rt/bloodsugar n/5`
.. Prerequisites: There are exactly 3 distinct weeks of blood sugar records and no BMI records.
... Test case: `average a/weekly rt/bloodsugar` +
    Expected: Since there are only 3 blood sugar records, the graph will only have 3 data points
    with dates of the 3 most recent blood sugar records in terms of week. There is not enough
    records to show 5 data points.
... Test case: `average a/weekly rt/bmi` +
    Expected: Since there are no bmi records, an error message is displayed saying +
    `Sorry! You do not have any BMI record.`
.. Prerequisites: There are at least 12 distinct months of BMI records and no blood sugar records.
... Test case: `average a/monthly rt/bmi n/9` +
    Expected: Shows a graph with 9 data points and these points are the average
    BMI values of the 9 most recent month.
... Test case: `average a/monthly rt/expenses n/3` +
    Expected: This is an unsupported record type. Following error message will be shown: +
    `Please enter correct input for rt/RECORD_TYPE! +
    RECORD_TYPE is "BLOODSUGAR" or "BMI"`
... Test case: `average a/monthly rt/bmi n/13` +
    Expected: COUNT field is out of the range 1 and 12 inclusive. Following error message will be shown: +
    `Please enter correct input for n/COUNT! +
    COUNT takes integer value between 1 and 12 inclusive.`
... Test case: `average a/monthly rt/bmi n/five` +
    Expected: COUNT field only takes integer value. Following error message will be shown: +
    `Please enter correct input for n/COUNT! +
    COUNT takes integer value between 1 and 12 inclusive.`
