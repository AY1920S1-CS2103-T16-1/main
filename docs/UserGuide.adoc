=== Food Recommendation

==== Recommending food: `recmf`

To make searching more efficient, the user can specify two kinds of filters:

* food type: in the form of following flags:

    -nsv: non-starchy vegetable, such as broccoli

    -sv: starchy vegetable, such as potato

    -f: fruit, such as cherry

    -p: protein, such as lean lamb

    -s: snack, such fig roll

    -m: meal, such as spanish omelet

Note::
** Flags are case-insensitive.
** If no flag is specifies, it is equivalent to specifying all flags. Namely, foods of all types will be shown.
** For fast typing, white spaces are allowed before, between, or after flags. Duplicate flags are also allowed.

* food name: in the form of `fn/FOOD_NAME [FOOD_NAME]...` +

Note::
** Food names are case-insensitive.
** Food name matching is full-word matching. For example, "ch" does not match "chicken", which "chicken" matches both "Chicken" and "Rice with Chicken".
** `fn/` is the only allowed prefix for `recmf` command. If only `fn/` presents without following food names, all foods (of specified types) will be shown.

Format: `recmf [-nsv] [-sv] [-f] [-p] [-s] [-m] [fn/FOOD_NAME FOOD_NAME...]`

Examples:

`recmf -p -f` `recmf fn/chicken` `recmf -p -m -f fn/chicken`

==== Adding new food items : `addfood`

Adds a new food item of certain category for future recommendations.
The following six fields are compulsorily required:

* food name: `fn/FOOD_NAME` +
Food name should be less than 30 characters. This is mainly for display quality and readability.
Only alphabets, numbers, and whitespace are allowed in the name.

* food type: `ft/FOOD_TYPE` +
Food types should be exactly one of the following: nsv(non-starchy vegetable), sv(starchy vegetable),
f(fruit), p(protein), s(snack), m(meal).
* calorie (cal): `ca/CALORIE` +
Calorie should be less than 700(cal) to be considered as safe for type II diabetes patients.
* gi: `gi/GI` +
Glycemic Index should be less than 70 to be considered as safe for type II diabetes patients.
* sugar (g): `su/SUGAR` +
Sugar should be less than 25(g) to be considered as safe for type II diabetes patients.
* fat (g): `fa/FAT` +
Fat should be less than 35(g) to be considered as safe for type II diabetes patients.

Note::
** No duplicate food names are allowed.
** All nutrition values are numerical values and should be equal or greater than zero.
Besides, the values are suggested to be per serving.
** The order of fields is flexible.
** Duplicate fields are allowed and only the last one will be considered. Therefore, the last occurrence must be in
valid format for the command to be executed.
